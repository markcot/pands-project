## Introduction
This project concerns the well-known 'Fisherâ€™s Iris data set' [1].
The project entails researching the data set, writing documentation and
code in the Python programming language [2] based on that research.

The data set has been widely investigated and written about it, much of which has
published online in the field of pattern recognition and machine learning.

## Research

The data set [1] was introduced in a paper by botanist Ronald A. Fisher in 1936, but
was originally collected in 1935 and published in 1936 by botanist Edgar S. Anderson
[3]. The data set is also referred to as 'Anderson's Iris data set'.

The data relates to the classification of 3 variant classes of Iris flower based on
their characteristics with fifty instances of each class. Data was presented giving
four attributes relating to the variation within each class and a fifth attribute for
the class variant name, namely:

Five attributes in Fisher's Iris data set [1]

    1) Sepal length in cm
    2) Sepal width in cm 
    3) Petal length in cm
    4) Petal width in cm
    5) Class variant name

Three Iris flower class variant names in Fisher's Iris data set [1]

    A) Iris Setosa
    B) Iris Versicolour
    C) Iris Virginica

Sepals are outermost oragns of a flower that form a protective casing for the
developing flower bud inside and support the flower. They are usually green and leaf
like [4]. Petals are the organ of a flower that are often noticeably coloured to
attract pollinators [5].

Previous research [1] has shown that one class in the data set (Iris Setosa) is
easily separable from the other two linearly. There is some overlap between the other
two classes making it difficult to distinguish from each other. A previous report [6]
on the data set noted that two of species were all collected on the same day from the
same pasture in Gaspe Peninsula and measured by the same person with the same
apparatus.

There are known errors [1] in the 35th and 38th samples. Sample 35 has an error in
the fourth attribute and sample 38 has an error in the second and third attribute.
The corrected data set instances should be:

    Sample 35) 4.9,3.1,1.5,0.2,"Iris-setosa"
    Sample 38) 4.9,3.6,1.4,0.1,"Iris-setosa"

Fisher's Iris data set can be downloaded online [7] as the file labeled 'iris.data',
which can be saved as a .csv file. The data set file has been included in this
project folder for reference saved as 'iris-data-set.csv'.

Online observations [8] highlight the data in Fisher's Iris data set [1] is of good
quality and is based on real life data. The quantity of data is large enough to be
of use, but small enough to be portable and easily experimented with. It is also
numerical. All of which makes it an ideal data set for teaching purposes.
