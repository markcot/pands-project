# Import modules, import csv file and review groups

# A program to read an input from a csv file of the 'Fisherâ€™s Iris data set'
# The program analyses the iris data set and makes a few plots.
#
# The program takes a single additional filename from an argument on the command
# line. Note that a single additional text filename has to be specified after the
# program # name. e.g. >>python analyse.py iris-data-set.csv
# The program prints an error if no additional filename is provided
# The program prints an error if two or more additional filenames are provided 

# import matplotlib pyplot, numnpy and pandas modules abbreviated to np, pd & pl
# Code from Week 9 lecture & website
# http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html

# Opens the python sys module
# Code adpted from Week 9 lecture of command line arguments in python

# Datframe df is for saving the content of the csv file

# Test to check if number of arguments supplied is = 2
# Code adapted from Mark Cotter pands problem set Exercise 9 - second.py

    # The formated code with {} refers to the second argument of the python
